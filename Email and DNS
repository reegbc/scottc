Email

Email, which stands for electronic mail, is a method of transmitting messages through the internet or a network. The message is written by typing it into an email client, and has a header attached that contains information such as who the email is from and where it is going. Using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) the message is sent to what is known as the sender’s SMTP server, where it is then directed to the recipient’s mail server. This server stores the email until the recipient requests delivery. The two most popular protocols for delivery from the recipient’s server are Internet Message Access Protocol, version 4, (IMAP4) and the older Post Office Protocol, version 3 (POP3). With IMAP4 the message stays stored on the mail server and is accessed remotely, while with POP3 the message is downloaded directly to the receiver’s computer.

DNS

DNS stands for Domain Name Service (or server). They can be most easily described as the phone book of the internet, containing a directory of domain names and their associated IP addresses. A domain name is the readable address of a website (eg: wikipedia.org). This is useful for remembering a website’s address without having to memorize an IP address, which could appear to be a series of meaningless numbers to the uninformed. When you type a domain name into your browser’s address bar, your computer requests that your DNS server finds which IP address is associated with the domain name, connecting you to it and displaying the page. It is worth noting that trying to skip the domain name process and simply trying to connect directly to an IP may not always work. This is because the server at that IP may be hosting more than one website.
